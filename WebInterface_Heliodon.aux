\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Left) Above is a screenshot the sketching interface where participants create 2D architectural sketches. The designs of participants, that have not opted out, are saved for inclusion into our user study. Moreover, we save these designs with intension of analysing the 2D architectural sketches that our algorithm could not convert into 3D models. This analysis will help us, the investigators, in improving our algorithm for the Web Interface for the Virtual Heliodon. Right) Participants can also view 3D daylighting simulation results from their 2D architectural sketches. Notice how throughout the application the feedback we are collecting is non-intrusive and located on the right hand side. \relax }}{10}}
