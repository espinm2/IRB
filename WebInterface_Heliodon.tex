\paragraph{Objective:}
%
Our goal in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of 
our web based sketching interface for the creation of closed architectural 
geometries and daylighting analysis.

\paragraph{Methods:}
%
Users in our study will begin by visiting a provided URL serviced by a password protected lab machine.
Users will be required to register by providing a username of their choice and a password.
During registration users will be given a brief explanation of their participation in our
user study. There will also be an option to opt out of the user study, but still use our web interface. 
This opt out option will be clearly displayed when registering for our web application.
We will not use designs or feedback of users who have opted out of the study.
A sample screenshot of the registration process is shown below.
After a successful login users will then be taken the main page of our application.
The application is split into two parts. On the left hand side are the tools required to
make sketches and generate 3D models. On the right hand side is a feedback panel with question 
that can be answered at any point of the study. These questions are not required to be answered in order
to use the web interface. Users can choose to answer some questions, but leave others blank.
Participants can stop at any point in time and continue by logging into the web interface
with their username and password.\\

\noindent
The questions asked are attached at the end of this document. (Along with sample screenshots)

\paragraph{Effects on Subjects:} See benefits and risks.

\paragraph{Benefits to Participants:}
%
The participants will gain first-hand experience with a new online sketching
environment for the generation of 3D models, and an understanding of the 
iterative design process of creating architectural spaces. The results 
of the study will lead to the use, development, and improvement of algorithms that
interpret architectural sketches. In addition user's feedback will lead to 
improvements in our daylighting visualizations.


\paragraph{Minimization of Possible Risks:}   
% 
There is no rick of physical harm in our web interface study. 
The only tool required to participate in this study is a computer and webbrowser.
We have considered the issue of computer security. Users will provided two kinds 
of digital information: design files and feedback. 
Design files are created automatically as the participants uses our interface. 
These files save user's sketches in a format that is unique to our interface.
To protect users we have a login system that requires a unique username and password pair. Users will be able to
revisit the website to review/edit design files and feedback.
The application is designed to store information created by users on a PostgreSQL 
database serviced by the Computer Science Department, of which only investigators have direct access to.
The machine hosting this webpage will be using an up to date Apache server and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)
for maximal security. We will also hash user's password, such that no where on the system will
user's passwords be stored in plain text.
Users are not required to download anything on their computers to participate in this study, nor will
they be required to make security exceptions on firewalls or anti-virus protection software.
Our webpage is only dependent on users having a webbrowser (Firefox or Chrome) to participate.

\noindent
The answers to some questions may contain personally identifiable information.
For example participant are asked to identify what room they are creating a sketch of, more over users are asked how often they visit this room.
All the questions in our survey are optional, including those questions which may contain personally identifiable information.

\paragraph{Likelihood of  Harm:}   None
\paragraph{Alternate Method Not Using Human Subjects:} None

\paragraph{Qualifications of Researcher:}
Barbara Cutler has a PhD in Computer Science from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  Max Espinoza is a 3th year PhD student in
Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying computer
graphics.

\paragraph{Recruiting of Subjects:}
We will ask for online volunteers to use our webpage and participate in this
user study. We will advertise our web page to student volunteers (18 years or older) 
via posters, campus related social media, and direct contact with students attending 
related courses. We will obtain permission of the course instructors to advertise 
for the participation of their students, but participation in the study will be 
voluntary and will not impact their course grade. The faculty advisor for the 
study (Barbara Cutler) will not recruit students in her courses to participate.  
The names of the students who did or did not participate in the study will be 
confidential and will not be released to their instructors.

We are particularly interested in participants with experience in 3D modeling, 
architectural daylighting, general architecture, and visual arts. We are looking 
for users with formal education and experience in the above fields to provide 
us valuable feedback to improve our web interface's usability and functionality. 
This experience is not required for participation in the user study, but the 
subject's will have an opportunity to note prior experience in these related fields.

\paragraph{Confidentiality:} 
Participants will register themselves with a username of their choice,
when logging into the web interface for the first time. 
We do not require users to use any personally identified usernames and password pairs such as those provided by
the RPI (RSC IDs). We work under the assumption that users follow standard practices for the creation 
and management of their login credential's.
The participates can stop and continue where they left off at any point during this study using their
unique usernames. Users will also provide a password, which we will hash using SHA-1 method. 
This hashed password is used to protect user's design file and
feedback information. No where in our application will the user be asked for their real 
name. Participants will be identified by a randomly assigned ID number that is used only for 
this study. All recorded user information and design files will be labeled with this ID 
(and not the participant's username). All information and data relating to the user study 
will be protected to secure confidentiality. All electronic files will be stored on password 
protected computers in locked offices, which can be accessed only by the investigators of 
the user study. The correspondence between ID number and participant username will be recorded 
by Barbara Cutler and stored on a password protected computer, accessible only by her. 
This correspondence will be destroyed once analysis of the data is complete, within 1 year 
after participation in the study.

\paragraph{Registration and Login Sample:}
When users visit our URL they will be directed to a registration page. Users who have already previously registered can navigate another page to sign in. Screenshots of the registration page are provided below. On this page users are only required to provide a username and password. In addition there is a brief prompt explaining what information is being recorded and an option to opt out of this study. All other kinds of user input beyond this point are optional.
